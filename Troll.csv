Title,"Troll"
ButtonTextureName,"Troll"
Summary,"Trolls are shaggy, green-skinned creatures which often are set to guard areas by high level mages. They are generally stupid, but regenerate any damage done to them quickly. Killing a troll is almost impossible, for doing so would require that the damage was done in such a way as to destroy the flesh, rather than just sever it. It is for this reason that they make such formidable adversaries."
Advice,"Use fire or poison spells to destroy its corpse."
Material,"Silver or higher is required."
Language,"Orcish"
