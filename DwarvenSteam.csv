Summary,"Dwemer Centurions, sometimes referred to as Constructs or Animunculi, are mechanical and magical artifacts often encountered in Dwemer ruins. Many of them are still active, and are usually hostile to intruders. It is unknown what drives them, but it is speculated that they are steam-powered, as they feature pipes and vents, from which steam blasts erupt intermittently."
